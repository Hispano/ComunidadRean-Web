Comunidad Rean Web page based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
=================

Bootstrap provides simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and Javascript for popular user interface components and interactions. In other words, it's a front-end toolkit for faster, more beautiful web development. It's created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat) at Twitter.
